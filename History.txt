 Overweight problems began in childhood.  My grandmother fed me with pies, and my mother with sweets, as a result, already at the age of 19, the weight exceeded all permissible norms.  Stretch marks appeared, huge complexes.  I tried to diet, but the food cravings were stronger.  A colleague from my motherâ€™s work told me about CustomKetoDiet.
 She said that she was able to lose 18 kg in just 2 months, without restricting herself in food, eating tasty and varied, and I grabbed this method like a lifeline.  I connected sports, and after 2 weeks I noticed that there were much fewer acne on my face, and I suffered with them all my adolescence, and most importantly, the kilograms go away.  And yes, my food breakdowns have disappeared and I no longer overeat at night, but I eat balanced.
